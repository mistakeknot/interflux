# Flux-Review — Multi-Track Deep Review

Run a fan-out/fan-in review across **multiple semantic distance tiers**. Each track generates specialized agents at a different distance from the target's domain, runs flux-drive independently, then a synthesis step merges findings across all tracks — highlighting cross-track convergence as the highest-confidence signal.

## Why Multiple Tracks?

Each semantic distance tier unlocks qualitatively different insights:
- **Adjacent** agents catch issues requiring deep domain expertise (migration safety, API contracts, concurrency)
- **Orthogonal** agents surface patterns from parallel disciplines at the same abstraction level (e.g., reviewing a pipeline through the lens of supply chain logistics or broadcast engineering)
- **Esoteric** agents apply structural patterns from maximally distant fields — mechanisms from perfumery, paleography, tidal dynamics, etc. that map to the target's architecture

The garden-salon experiment (22 agents, 3 rounds) showed that each additional distance increment produced qualitatively different insights, not just more of the same. But for focused code changes, 2 tracks suffices.

## Model Routing

Different steps and tracks have different cognitive demands. The default routing (`--quality=balanced`) puts the best model where the judgment bottleneck actually is, not uniformly.

### Why track-aware routing?

- **Agent design** for adjacent tracks is routine (list domain subtopics) — Sonnet handles this. But designing esoteric/distant agents requires **creative breadth** to find genuinely novel domains like "monastic scriptoria" — Opus's broader associative range matters here.
- **Reviews** for adjacent tracks need **deep domain reasoning** to catch subtle issues — Opus. But distant/esoteric track reviews are **lens application** (faithfully applying an unusual but well-defined perspective) — Sonnet is adequate.
- **Synthesis** is the **highest-judgment step**: distinguishing real structural isomorphisms from surface analogies, detecting cross-track convergence, filtering quality. Always Opus.

### Routing table

| Step | Track A (Adjacent) | Track B (Orthogonal) | Track C (Distant) | Track D (Esoteric) |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Agent Design** | sonnet | sonnet | **opus** | **opus** |
| **Flux-Drive Review** | **opus** | sonnet | sonnet | sonnet |
| **Synthesis** | — | — | — | **opus** (single step across all tracks) |

**Rationale per cell:**
- Design A/B → Sonnet: Listing domain subtopics and parallel disciplines is well-specified. The LLM doesn't need broad associative range.
- Design C/D → Opus: Finding "physical oceanography" or "indigenous wayfinding" as review lenses requires the creative leap that correlates with model capability. Sonnet collapses to familiar analogies (biology, military).
- Review A → Opus: Domain-expert findings need the deepest reasoning. A migration atomicity specialist on Sonnet misses subtler transaction boundary issues.
- Review B/C/D → Sonnet: These agents apply an unusual lens to the target. The lens is defined in the agent prompt; the review step is faithful application, not creative invention. Sonnet follows well-defined agent prompts reliably.
- Synthesis → Opus: Cross-track convergence detection, isomorphism quality filtering, and "was the outer track actually useful?" judgment require the highest reasoning. This step reads summaries (~20-40k tokens), so the Opus cost is modest.

### Quality overrides

| Flag | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `--quality=balanced` | Track-aware routing (table above). Default. |
| `--quality=economy` | All Sonnet. ~4x cheaper. Use for quick passes or cost-sensitive reviews. |
| `--quality=max` | All Opus. Maximum quality. Use when findings justify the cost. |

`--creative` auto-selects `--quality=max` (4 tracks + all Opus) since the user is explicitly optimizing for insight quality over cost.

## Step 0: Parse Arguments and Triage

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- Extract the file or directory path (required)
- Extract `--tracks=auto|2|3|4` (default: `auto`)
- Extract `--quality=balanced|economy|max` (default: `balanced`)
- Extract `--creative` flag (shorthand for `--tracks=4 --quality=max`)
- If path is empty, use AskUserQuestion to get it

Set `QUALITY_MODE` from the flag. This determines model routing per step (see Model Routing table above).

Derive:
```
INPUT_PATH    = <the path provided>
PROJECT_ROOT  = <nearest ancestor directory containing .git, or directory of INPUT_PATH>
TARGET_DESC   = <1-line description derived from reading the file/directory>
SLUG          = <kebab-case from TARGET_DESC, max 40 chars>
DATE          = <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

Read the target (first 200 lines if file, README/CLAUDE.md if directory) to derive TARGET_DESC.

### Track Count Triage (when `--tracks=auto`)

Determine optimal track count based on target characteristics:

| Signal | Track Count | Reasoning |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Focused code change (<100 lines, single file, bugfix/migration) | **2** (adjacent + distant) | Deep domain expertise + one cross-domain check |
| Module or feature (~100-500 lines, multiple files, new feature) | **3** (adjacent + orthogonal + distant) | Specialist + parallel-discipline + structural |
| Architecture doc, PRD, or design brainstorm | **4** (adjacent + orthogonal + distant + esoteric) | Maximum creative surface — each tier unlocks different insight types |
| Directory review (entire module or subproject) | **3** | Broad but not full creative exploration |
| `--creative` flag present | **4** | User explicitly wants maximum exploration |

Classify the target by reading it and applying the table above. Set `TRACK_COUNT`.

### Track Definitions

Each track has a name, a semantic distance tier, and generation instructions:

| Track | Name | Distance | Agents | When Used |
|-------|------|----------|--------|-----------|
| A | **Adjacent** | Near | 5 | Always (tracks ≥ 2) |
| B | **Orthogonal** | Medium | 4 | tracks ≥ 3 |
| C | **Distant** | Far | 4 | tracks ≥ 2 |
| D | **Esoteric** | Maximum | 3 | tracks = 4 |

Total agents by track count: 2 tracks = 10, 3 tracks = 13, 4 tracks = 16.

Note: Track C (Distant) is always included (it's the second track for 2-track mode). Track B (Orthogonal) is the **middle** tier added at 3 tracks. Track D (Esoteric) is the outer frontier added at 4 tracks.

---

## Step 1: Confirm

Use **AskUserQuestion** showing the triaged plan:

```
Multi-track deep review of: {INPUT_PATH}
Target: {TARGET_DESC}
Tracks: {TRACK_COUNT} (triaged as: {triage_reason})
Quality: {QUALITY_MODE}

{for each active track:}
  Track {letter} ({name}): {agent_count} agents
    Design: {design_model}  Review: {review_model}
Synthesis: {synthesis_model}

Total: up to {total_agents} agents, {TRACK_COUNT} parallel reviews
Estimated context: ~{estimated_tokens}k tokens

Proceed?
```

For estimated tokens, use: economy ≈ TRACK_COUNT × 80k, balanced ≈ TRACK_COUNT × 100k, max ≈ TRACK_COUNT × 120k.

Options:
- "Proceed with {TRACK_COUNT} tracks (Recommended)"
- "More tracks (add creative exploration)" — increases by 1 track
- "Fewer tracks (just adjacent + distant)" — reduces to 2
- "Cancel"

---

## Step 2: Fan-Out — Generate All Track Agent Sets in Parallel

Launch **all active tracks in parallel** using the Agent tool. Model per track depends on `QUALITY_MODE`:

| Track | economy | balanced | max |
|-------|---------|----------|-----|
| A (Adjacent) design | sonnet | sonnet | opus |
| B (Orthogonal) design | sonnet | sonnet | opus |
| C (Distant) design | sonnet | **opus** | opus |
| D (Esoteric) design | sonnet | **opus** | opus |

Each track subagent must: (1) design agent specs via LLM, (2) save specs to JSON, (3) call generate-agents.py. All tracks run simultaneously.

### Common Preamble (included in all track prompts)

```
Target: {TARGET_DESC}
File/directory: {INPUT_PATH}

Severity reference:
- P0: Blocks other work or causes data loss/corruption. Drop everything.
- P1: Required to exit the current quality gate.
- P2: Degrades quality or creates maintenance burden.
- P3: Improvements and polish.

For each agent, output a JSON object with:
- name, focus, persona, decision_lens, review_areas (4-6 bullets),
  severity_examples (2-3 objects with severity/scenario/condition),
  success_hints, task_context, anti_overlap

Design rules:
- Names: fd-{domain}-{concern}
- Each agent covers a DISTINCT aspect
- Review areas must be specific and actionable
- severity_examples must be concrete failure scenarios
- anti_overlap references other agents in this batch

Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No markdown.
```

### Track A: Adjacent (always active, 5 agents)

Additional prompt:
```
You are an expert at designing specialized code review agents.

Design 5 agents with DEEP EXPERTISE in the target's own domain and closely
adjacent fields. These agents should catch issues that require specialist
knowledge of the target's technology, patterns, and failure modes.

For example, if reviewing a database migration system:
- fd-migration-atomicity (transaction safety specialist)
- fd-schema-evolution (backward compatibility expert)
- fd-query-performance (execution plan analyst)
- fd-data-integrity (constraint and invariant guardian)
- fd-rollback-safety (deployment recovery specialist)
```

Specs: `{PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/flux-gen-specs/{SLUG}-adjacent.json`

### Track B: Orthogonal (active when TRACK_COUNT ≥ 3, 4 agents)

Additional prompt:
```
You are designing review agents from PARALLEL DISCIPLINES — fields at the same
abstraction level as the target but in different industries or domains.

Design 4 agents from disciplines that operate at a similar scale and complexity
as the target, but in a different professional context. These agents surface
patterns that practitioners in adjacent-but-different fields take for granted.

For example, if reviewing an event-driven pipeline:
- fd-broadcast-scheduling (television broadcast engineering: real-time sequencing)
- fd-supply-chain-flow (logistics: pipeline throughput and bottleneck detection)
- fd-air-traffic-sequencing (ATC: priority queuing under safety constraints)
- fd-newsroom-workflow (editorial: multi-source aggregation with deadline pressure)

Selection constraints:
- Each domain must be a PROFESSIONAL DISCIPLINE with established best practices
- Domains must be at the same abstraction level as the target (not micro/macro)
- Avoid pure-science domains (save those for distant/esoteric tracks)
- Each agent must bring a specific operational pattern that maps to the target

Additional fields per agent:
- source_domain: the professional discipline
- distance_rationale: 1 sentence — how is this parallel but different?
- expected_isomorphisms: 1-2 sentences — what operational patterns transfer?
```

Specs: `{PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/flux-gen-specs/{SLUG}-orthogonal.json`

### Track C: Distant (active when TRACK_COUNT ≥ 2, 4 agents for 2-track, 4 agents otherwise)

When TRACK_COUNT = 2, generate 5 agents. Otherwise generate 4.

Additional prompt:
```
You are exploring the semantic space of knowledge domains to find structural
isomorphisms relevant to a review target.

Design {4 or 5} agents from domains FAR FROM the target's field. These agents
apply structural patterns from unrelated disciplines to surface insights
invisible from within the target's domain.

Selection constraints:
- Each domain must come from a different field, era, or modality
- DO NOT use common AI-analogy domains: biology, military strategy, sports,
  information theory, thermodynamics, ecology, evolutionary biology, game theory,
  economic markets, ant colonies, neural networks, immune systems
- PREFER: pre-modern craft disciplines, physical processes at non-human scales,
  non-Western knowledge systems, professional practices with centuries of refinement
- Each domain must have rich internal structure that maps to the target's concerns
- No two agents may share the same parent discipline

Additional fields per agent:
- source_domain: the real-world knowledge domain
- distance_rationale: 1 sentence — why is this distant from the target?
- expected_isomorphisms: 1-2 sentences — what structural parallels do you expect?
```

Specs: `{PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/flux-gen-specs/{SLUG}-distant.json`

### Track D: Esoteric (active when TRACK_COUNT = 4, 3 agents)

Additional prompt:
```
You are pushing to the absolute frontier of the semantic space. Design agents
from the most UNEXPECTED, ALIEN knowledge domains you can find — domains that
no practitioner in the target's field would ever think to consult.

Design 3 agents from domains at MAXIMUM SEMANTIC DISTANCE. These should
provoke genuine surprise. Think: domains separated by centuries, continents,
and scales of observation. The structural isomorphisms should feel impossible
until explained.

Selection constraints:
- Domains must be genuinely surprising — if a software engineer would say
  "oh yeah, that's a common analogy," REJECT it and go further
- Each domain must come from a different civilization, era, or physical scale
- Include at least one domain that is PRE-INDUSTRIAL and one that is NON-WESTERN
- The structural mapping must be SPECIFIC (name the mechanism), not metaphorical
- No overlap with domains in other tracks

Additional fields per agent:
- source_domain: the knowledge domain (name the specific tradition or practice)
- distance_rationale: 1 sentence — why would no one think to look here?
- expected_isomorphisms: 1-2 sentences — what specific mechanism transfers?
```

Specs: `{PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/flux-gen-specs/{SLUG}-esoteric.json`

### After all tracks complete

Each subagent calls generate-agents.py:
```
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/generate-agents.py {PROJECT_ROOT} --from-specs <specs-file> --mode=skip-existing --json
```

Display results per track:
```
Track A (Adjacent):   {N} domain-expert agents
Track B (Orthogonal): {N} parallel-discipline agents     [if active]
Track C (Distant):    {N} distant-domain agents
Track D (Esoteric):   {N} frontier-domain agents          [if active]
Total: {sum} agents generated
```

If any track fails, report which failed and proceed with successful tracks.

---

## Step 3: Fan-Out — Run Flux-Drive Reviews in Parallel

Launch **one flux-drive review per active track** using the Agent tool, all in parallel with `run_in_background: true`. Model per track depends on `QUALITY_MODE`:

| Track | economy | balanced | max |
|-------|---------|----------|-----|
| A (Adjacent) review | sonnet | **opus** | opus |
| B (Orthogonal) review | sonnet | sonnet | opus |
| C (Distant) review | sonnet | sonnet | opus |
| D (Esoteric) review | sonnet | sonnet | opus |

For each active track, launch an Agent tool with the appropriate model:

```
Run a flux-drive review of {INPUT_PATH}.

Use the `/interflux:flux-drive {INPUT_PATH}` skill. This will auto-discover
the project agents (including the newly generated {track_name}-domain agents)
and run the full triage → launch → synthesize pipeline.

Focus on {track_focus_description}. The generated agents for this track
({list agent names}) should be triaged as Project Agents.
```

Track focus descriptions:
- **Track A (Adjacent):** "domain-expert findings requiring specialist knowledge"
- **Track B (Orthogonal):** "operational patterns from parallel professional disciplines"
- **Track C (Distant):** "structural isomorphisms from distant knowledge domains"
- **Track D (Esoteric):** "frontier patterns from maximally unexpected domains"

**Wait for all reviews to complete.** Display progress as each finishes:
```
✓ Track A (Adjacent) review complete: {N} findings
✓ Track B (Orthogonal) review complete: {N} findings     [if active]
✓ Track C (Distant) review complete: {N} findings
✓ Track D (Esoteric) review complete: {N} findings        [if active]
```

---

## Step 4: Fan-In — Cross-Track Synthesis

Read findings from all flux-drive runs. The reviews write findings to `docs/research/flux-drive/{INPUT_STEM}/`.

Since all runs write to the same output directory, findings from all agents across all tracks will be there. Read all `.md` files.

Launch a synthesis subagent. Model depends on `QUALITY_MODE`: **economy** → sonnet, **balanced** → opus, **max** → opus.

```
You are synthesizing findings from a multi-track deep review.

Target: {TARGET_DESC}
File: {INPUT_PATH}

The review ran {TRACK_COUNT} parallel tracks at increasing semantic distance:
{for each active track:}
- Track {letter} ({name}): {N} agents — {distance_description}
  Agents: {list names + focus [+ source_domain for B/C/D]}

Findings from all agents:
{all findings content from docs/research/flux-drive/{INPUT_STEM}/}

Produce a unified synthesis with these sections:

## Critical Findings (P0/P1)
Issues requiring immediate action. For each:
- The finding and which agent(s) surfaced it
- Which track(s) it came from (adjacent, orthogonal, distant, esoteric)
- Concrete fix recommendation

## Cross-Track Convergence
Findings that appeared independently in 2+ tracks — the highest-confidence
signals because they were discovered through independent reasoning paths at
different semantic distances. For each convergent finding:
- Which tracks independently surfaced it (name the agents from each track)
- How each track's perspective frames the same issue differently
- The convergence score: how many independent tracks found it (2/2, 2/3, 3/4, etc.)

Rank convergent findings by convergence score (more tracks = higher confidence).

## Domain-Expert Insights (Track A)
The most valuable findings from adjacent-domain specialists that require deep
domain knowledge to identify. Group by theme.

## Parallel-Discipline Insights (Track B) [if Track B active]
Operational patterns surfaced by orthogonal-domain agents — professional
practices from parallel disciplines that map to the target's workflow.
For each: the source discipline, the specific practice, and how it maps.

## Structural Insights (Track C)
Novel patterns surfaced by distant-domain agents — mechanisms from other fields
that reveal something about the target's architecture. For each:
- The source domain and structural isomorphism
- How it maps to the target
- Whether it suggests a concrete improvement or is an open question

## Frontier Patterns (Track D) [if Track D active]
The most surprising patterns from esoteric domains. These should provoke
genuine "I never would have thought of that" reactions. For each:
- The source domain and why it is unexpected
- The specific mechanism and how it maps
- Whether this opens a new design direction or refines an existing one

## Synthesis Assessment
- Overall quality of the target (1-2 sentences)
- Highest-leverage improvement (the single change that would have the most impact)
- Surprising finding (something no single track would surface alone)
- Semantic distance value: did the outer tracks (C/D) contribute insights
  qualitatively different from the inner tracks (A/B), or did they mostly
  restate the same issues in different vocabulary?

Write in direct, technical prose. Name agents when attributing findings.
Prioritize convergent findings (found across multiple tracks) over single-track findings.
```

Write synthesis to `{PROJECT_ROOT}/docs/research/flux-review/{SLUG}/{DATE}-synthesis.md` with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
artifact_type: review-synthesis
method: flux-review
target: "{INPUT_PATH}"
target_description: "{TARGET_DESC}"
tracks: {TRACK_COUNT}
track_a_agents: [{Track A names}]
track_b_agents: [{Track B names}]  # if active
track_c_agents: [{Track C names}]
track_d_agents: [{Track D names}]  # if active
date: {DATE}
---
```

---

## Step 5: Report

```
Multi-track review complete for: {INPUT_PATH}
Tracks: {TRACK_COUNT} ({triage_reason})

{for each active track:}
  Track {letter} ({name}): {N} agents, {findings} findings
Cross-track convergence: {convergent_count} findings appeared in 2+ tracks

Synthesis: docs/research/flux-review/{SLUG}/{DATE}-synthesis.md

Agent specs:
{for each active track:}
  {name}: .claude/flux-gen-specs/{SLUG}-{track_slug}.json

To rerun with existing agents: /flux-drive {INPUT_PATH}
To regenerate a track: /flux-gen --from-specs .claude/flux-gen-specs/{SLUG}-{track_slug}.json
```

---

## Notes

- All tracks run flux-drive independently and in parallel — they share the same triage/scoring pipeline but operate on different agent pools
- Cross-track convergence (same issue found from independent reasoning paths at different semantic distances) is the highest-confidence signal — rank by convergence score (N tracks agreeing)
- Track count is triaged from target characteristics but can be overridden (`--tracks=N` or `--creative`)
- Model routing is track-aware by default (`--quality=balanced`): Opus for creative design (C/D), deep reviews (A), and synthesis; Sonnet for routine design (A/B) and lens-application reviews (B/C/D). Override with `--quality=economy` (all Sonnet) or `--quality=max` (all Opus)
- The `--creative` flag is shorthand for `--tracks=4 --quality=max` — maximum tracks + maximum model quality for design exploration
- The distant and esoteric tracks use the same anti-clustering instruction as `/flux-explore` (13 blocked AI-analogy domains)
- Track specs are saved separately per track for independent regeneration
- If any track fails, the command degrades gracefully to the surviving tracks

### Cost estimates

| Config | Tracks | Quality | Opus tokens | Sonnet tokens | Approximate cost |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Quick code review | 2 | economy | 0 | ~200k | ~$0.60 |
| Standard code review | 2 | balanced | ~120k (review A + synthesis) | ~100k (design + review C) | ~$3 |
| Module review | 3 | balanced | ~140k | ~180k | ~$5 |
| Design exploration | 4 | balanced | ~160k | ~240k | ~$7 |
| Full creative | 4 | max | ~400k | 0 | ~$12 |

Cost estimates assume ~100k tokens per track. Actual cost varies with target size and agent count.
