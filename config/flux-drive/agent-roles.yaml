# Agent Role Mappings for Heterogeneous Routing (iv-jc4j)
#
# Inspired by Dr. MAS (Dynamic Role Multi-Agent Systems): assigns model tier
# per agent based on role capability requirements, not uniform per-phase defaults.
#
# Roles (from SC-MAS/Dr. MAS taxonomy):
#   planner   — High-capability model needed (architectural decisions, systems thinking)
#   reviewer  — Medium-high capability (detailed checking, correctness, safety)
#   editor    — Medium capability (practical suggestions, UX, performance)
#   checker   — Lower capability sufficient (pattern matching, format checking)
#
# model_tier maps to routing.yaml subagent overrides when complexity routing
# is in shadow or enforce mode. Currently informational — consumed by
# experiment scoring, not by lib-routing.sh dispatch.
#
# Safety rule (from iv-dthn Loop 4): fd-safety and fd-correctness NEVER
# route below Sonnet regardless of role assignment.
