## Review Agents (12)

### Technical Agents (7)

Auto-detect language from code under review. Each reads project CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md for codebase-aware analysis. YAML frontmatter: `name`, `description` (with `<example>` blocks), `model: sonnet`.

| Agent | Domain | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| fd-architecture | Module boundaries, coupling, design patterns, anti-patterns, complexity | planner (opus tier) |
| fd-safety | Threats, credentials, trust boundaries, deploy risk, rollback | reviewer (sonnet, safety floor) |
| fd-correctness | Data consistency, race conditions, transactions, async bugs | reviewer (sonnet, safety floor) |
| fd-quality | Naming, conventions, test approach, language-specific idioms | reviewer (sonnet) |
| fd-user-product | User flows, UX friction, value prop, scope, missing edge cases | editor (sonnet) |
| fd-performance | Bottlenecks, resource usage, algorithmic complexity, scaling | editor (sonnet) |
| fd-game-design | Balance, pacing, player psychology, feedback loops, emergent behavior | editor (sonnet) |

### Cognitive Agents (5)

Review documents only (plans, PRDs, strategies, brainstorms). Pre-filtered by SKILL.md Step 1.2a: only activate for `.md`/`.txt` inputs of document types. Never included for code or diff reviews. Use cognitive severity mapping: Blind Spot -> P1, Missed Lens -> P2, Consider Also -> P3.

| Agent | Domain | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| fd-systems | Feedback loops, emergence, causal reasoning, systems dynamics | planner (opus tier) |
| fd-decisions | Decision quality, framing effects, option coverage, reversibility | checker (haiku) |
| fd-people | Human systems, incentive alignment, organizational dynamics | checker (haiku) |
| fd-resilience | Adaptive capacity, failure modes, graceful degradation | checker (haiku) |
| fd-perception | Sensemaking, context sensitivity, signal/noise, cognitive bias | checker (haiku) |

### Agent Output Contract

- **Findings Index**: `SEVERITY | ID | "Section" | Title`
- **Verdict**: `safe | needs-changes | risky`
- **Completion signal**: `.partial` sentinel -> rename to final

### Model Routing

Agents get models resolved at launch time from Clavain's `config/routing.yaml` via `routing_resolve_agents()`. Resolution chain: agent override > phase+category > phase > default category > default model. Safety floors: fd-safety and fd-correctness never run below sonnet (enforced by `lib-routing.sh`).

The `model:` line in agent frontmatter serves as a fallback when routing.yaml is unavailable.

Role-to-tier mapping is in `config/flux-drive/agent-roles.yaml`.

## Research Agents (5)

Orchestrated by flux-drive in `mode=research`. Not invoked directly. Research Directives in domain profiles guide their search terms. All use `model: haiku`.

| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| best-practices-researcher | Industry standards, community conventions, implementation guidance |
| framework-docs-researcher | Official documentation, framework APIs, configuration reference |
| git-history-analyzer | Commit history patterns, file change frequency, authorship |
| learnings-researcher | Project learnings, past review findings, knowledge entries |
| repo-research-analyst | Codebase structure, module relationships, dependency analysis |

Selection uses a query-type affinity table (onboarding, how-to, why-is-it, what-changed, best-practice, debug-context, exploratory). Agents scoring >= 2 are dispatched. Domain bonus (+1) for agents with Research Directives in detected domain.

## Commands (4)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/interflux:flux-drive` | Multi-agent document/code review (default mode=review) |
| `/interflux:flux-research` | Multi-agent research — routes to flux-drive with mode=research |
| `/interflux:flux-gen` | Generate project-specific review agents from detected domains or free-form prompts |
| `/interflux:fetch-findings` | Inspect shared findings from parallel reviews |

### flux-gen Modes

- **Domain mode** (default): Deterministic template expansion from domain profiles. 11 known domains.
- **Prompt mode**: LLM (Sonnet subagent) designs 3-5 task-specific agents, then deterministic rendering.
- **Specs mode** (`--from-specs <path>`): Regenerate from saved specs without re-running LLM design.

Generated agents are written to `.claude/agents/fd-*.md` and get +1 category bonus in triage scoring.

## Skill: flux-drive

Single unified skill registered in plugin.json. Two modes selected by invocation:

- `/interflux:flux-drive` -> `MODE = review`
- `/interflux:flux-research` -> `MODE = research`

### Three-Phase Protocol

1. **Triage** — Detect project domains, profile input, score agents (base_score 0-3 + domain_boost 0-2 + project_bonus 0-1 + domain_agent 0-1 = max 7), present roster for user approval. Dynamic slot ceiling (4-12 agents). Budget-aware selection via `scripts/estimate-costs.sh`. Document slicing for inputs > 200 lines.
2. **Launch** — Dispatch Stage 1 agents in parallel, monitor completion, optionally expand to Stage 2 based on findings severity + adjacency scoring. AgentDropout prunes redundant agents (threshold 0.7). Safety-critical agents (fd-safety, fd-correctness) exempt from budget cuts and dropout.
3. **Synthesize** — Validate outputs, deduplicate findings, track convergence, compute verdict (safe/needs-changes/risky), generate findings.json + summary.md. Research mode delegates to `intersynth:synthesize-research`.

Phase files in `skills/flux-drive/phases/`:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `shared-contracts.md` | Output format, completion signals, content routing |
| `slicing.md` | Document and diff slicing algorithm, section mapping, routing patterns |
| `launch.md` | Stage dispatch, expansion scoring, interserve/Codex mode, AgentDropout |
| `launch-codex.md` | Codex CLI dispatch for interserve mode |
| `synthesize.md` | Deduplication, convergence, verdict, knowledge compounding |
| `cross-ai.md` | Optional cross-AI comparison via Oracle CLI |

Reference files in `skills/flux-drive/references/`:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `agent-roster.md` | Full roster: Project Agents, Plugin Agents, Cognitive Agents, Cross-AI |
| `scoring-examples.md` | 4 worked scoring examples across document types |

### Compact Variant

`SKILL-compact.md` (15K) is a single-file version of the same triage algorithm. When a `.skill-compact-manifest.json` exists, the compact version loads instead of the multi-file instructions.

## MCP Servers (1)

| Server | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| **exa** | stdio | External web research via Exa API. Progressive enhancement — requires `EXA_API_KEY`. Falls back to Context7 + WebSearch if unavailable. |

**Note:** qmd MCP server (semantic search for knowledge) has moved to the **interknow** plugin. The `launch-qmd.sh` script in `scripts/` is vestigial.

## Hooks (2)

Registered in `hooks/hooks.json` under `SessionStart`:

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `session-start.sh` | Ecosystem status reporting (`[interverse] beads=... \| ic=...`). Sources interbase SDK or falls back to no-ops. |
| `write-capabilities.sh` | Writes plugin capabilities for interbase integration |

## Domain Detection

LLM-free classification. `scripts/detect-domains.py` scans directories, files, build-system dependencies, and source keywords against signals defined in `config/flux-drive/domains/index.yaml` (11 domains). Results cached in `.claude/intersense.yaml` with structural hash for staleness detection via `scripts/content-hash.py`.

### 11 Domains

`game-simulation`, `web-api`, `ml-pipeline`, `cli-tool`, `mobile-app`, `embedded-systems`, `data-pipeline`, `library-sdk`, `tui-app`, `desktop-tauri`, `claude-code-plugin`

Each domain profile (`config/flux-drive/domains/<name>.md`) contains:
- Review criteria injected into agent prompts
- Agent injection specifications (which agents get domain-specific bullets)
- Research Directives for external research agents

Domain detection also delegates to the intersense plugin (canonical location) with local fallback.

## Knowledge Lifecycle

Managed by the **interknow** plugin (not interflux). Key concepts:

- **Provenance tracking**: `independent` (re-discovered without prompting) vs `primed` (re-confirmed while in context)
- **Temporal decay**: entries not independently confirmed in 10 reviews are archived
- **Injection**: top 5 relevant entries injected into agent prompts via semantic search (qmd, served by interknow)
- **Compounding**: new patterns extracted from review findings and saved via interknow

Local knowledge entries exist in `config/flux-drive/knowledge/` for reference and migration.

## Intermediate Finding Sharing

During parallel flux-drive reviews, agents share high-severity findings via `{OUTPUT_DIR}/peer-findings.jsonl`.

- **blocking**: contradicts another agent's analysis (MUST acknowledge)
- **notable**: significant finding that may affect others (SHOULD consider)

Helper script: `scripts/findings-helper.sh` (write/read operations).

## Budget and Cost

Configuration in `config/flux-drive/budget.yaml`:

- Budgets by input type: plan (150K), brainstorm (80K), diff-small (60K), diff-large (200K), repo (300K)
- Per-agent defaults: review (40K), cognitive (35K), research (15K), oracle (80K), generated (40K)
- Slicing multiplier: 0.5x for non-cross-cutting agents when slicing is active
- Minimum 2 agents always dispatched regardless of budget
- Enforcement: soft (warn + offer override)
- Exempt agents: fd-safety, fd-correctness (never dropped by budget or AgentDropout)
- AgentDropout threshold: 0.7 redundancy score

Cost estimation: `scripts/estimate-costs.sh` queries interstat historical data, falls back to budget.yaml defaults.

## Model Routing Experiments

`config/flux-drive/agent-roles.yaml` tracks routing experiments:

| Experiment | Status | Finding |
|------------|--------|---------|
| exp1_complexity_routing | complete | Hypothesis inverted — role-aware routing increases cost 20% |
| exp2_role_aware | complete | fd-safety on Haiku 47%, fd-correctness 26% — quality risk |
| exp3_collaboration_modes | deferred | Requires flux-drive dispatch changes |
| exp4_pareto_frontier | partial | B1 + safety floors is Pareto-optimal for current workload |

## Protocol Specification

Formal spec in `docs/spec/` (flux-drive-spec 1.0.0). Extracts the abstract protocol from the interflux reference implementation into standalone, framework-agnostic documents.

Three conformance levels:
- **Core**: 3-phase lifecycle, base scoring (0-4), staging, contracts, synthesis
- **Core + Domains**: adds domain detection, domain_boost/domain_agent_bonus (0-7)
- **Core + Knowledge**: adds provenance-tracked review memory with temporal decay

### Documents

| Path | Content |
|------|---------|
| `docs/spec/README.md` | Overview, conformance levels, reading order |
| `docs/spec/core/protocol.md` | 3-phase lifecycle |
| `docs/spec/core/scoring.md` | Agent selection algorithm |
| `docs/spec/core/staging.md` | Two-stage dispatch |
| `docs/spec/core/synthesis.md` | Findings aggregation |
| `docs/spec/contracts/findings-index.md` | Agent output format |
| `docs/spec/contracts/completion-signal.md` | Completion signaling |
| `docs/spec/extensions/domain-detection.md` | Domain signal scoring |
| `docs/spec/extensions/knowledge-lifecycle.md` | Knowledge decay + accumulation |

## Dual-Mode Architecture

interflux supports standalone (marketplace) and integrated (Interverse ecosystem) operation via the interbase SDK.

- **Standalone**: Stub falls back to no-ops. All review/research features work. No ecosystem features (phase tracking, nudges, sprint gates).
- **Integrated**: `~/.intermod/interbase/interbase.sh` sourced. Session-start hook reports ecosystem status. Nudge protocol suggests missing companions.

## Philosophy Alignment Protocol

Review [`PHILOSOPHY.md`](../../PHILOSOPHY.md) during:
- Intake/scoping
- Brainstorming
- Planning
- Execution kickoff
- Review/gates
- Handoff/retrospective

For brainstorming/planning outputs, add two short lines:
- **Alignment:** one sentence on how the proposal supports the module's purpose within Demarch's philosophy.
- **Conflict/Risk:** one sentence on any tension with philosophy (or 'none').

If a high-value change conflicts with philosophy, either:
- adjust the plan to align, or
- create follow-up work to update `PHILOSOPHY.md` explicitly.
