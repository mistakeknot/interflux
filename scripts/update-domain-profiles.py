"""Add Persona and Decision lens fields to Agent Specifications in domain profiles.

This script adds two new optional fields to each agent spec:
- Persona: one-line identity and voice directive
- Decision lens: one-line prioritization heuristic

These fields are used by flux-gen v2 to generate more effective project-specific agents.
Only updates agents under ## Agent Specifications (line 68+), not Injection Criteria.
