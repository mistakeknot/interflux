When a command references a function (`enforce_gate`) that exists in the upstream library (interphase lib-gates.sh) but is NOT re-exported by the shim layer (Clavain lib-gates.sh), calls silently fail. The shim only stubs functions it knows about — new upstream functions are invisible.

Fix: Add a wrapper function in the consuming library (lib-sprint.sh) that delegates to the upstream function if available, otherwise passes through:
```bash
enforce_gate() {
    if type check_phase_gate &>/dev/null; then
        check_phase_gate "$@"
    else
        return 0  # No gate library — pass through
    fi
}
```
This is preferable to modifying the shim (which would need version sync) or requiring the upstream library directly (which breaks the shim abstraction).

Evidence: sprint.md referenced `enforce_gate()` which existed in interphase lib-gates.sh (line 214) but was not in Clavain's lib-gates.sh shim (only 7 of ~15 functions re-exported). Architecture review caught this — pre-existing bug propagated into new plan.
Verify: For any shim pattern, compare exported function lists between shim and upstream: `grep -oP '^\w+\(\)' shim.sh` vs `grep -oP '^\w+\(\)' upstream.sh`.
